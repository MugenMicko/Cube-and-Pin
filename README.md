Cube and Pin Test for Extrusion Multiplier
This is a quick test for extrusion multiplier that will help for getting fitments between printed parts accurate.  Print the STL with your standard settings, once done, put the in into the hole in cube. The pin will not go in if you extrusion multiplier is incorrect.  There are marks on the pin, each of which represent 1 percent and each mark is about 1mm apart so if you can't see the marks, just use the depth section of your verniers.  You may get some significant reduction in extrusion multiplier, and this is may mean your e-steps are inaccurate but can also be impacted by extrusion swelling and any fill in the filament like carbon fiber or glass fiber.  Some filaments I find my extrusion multiplier at 0.92, I have some ABS-GF down as low as 0.74 but this is because that filament expands when extruded and has the glass fiber.  This has not impacted strength, that ABS-GF is strong as and has amazing layer adhesion, its just a quirk to the filament.  Using this methodology, if I have 2 different filaments with different extrusion multipliers, if I print each part with their specific extrusion mulitplier, they fit perfectly.  Give it a try and let me know how you find it.
